#	currently executing (or about to be executed in the current
#	frame).  The type determines how the remainder of the
#	arguments are to be interpreted and should be one of the
#	following values:
#		global	The stack frame is outside of any procedure
#			scope.  There are no additonal arguments.
#		proc	The statement is inside a procedure.  The
#			first argument is the procedure name and the
#			remaining arguments are the names of the

#		source	This entry in the stack is a virtual frame
#			that corresponds to a change in block due to a
#			source command.  There are no arguments.
#	Eventually we will want to provide support for other virtual
#	stack frames so we can handle other forms of dynamic code that
#	are executed in the current stack scope (e.g. eval).  For now
#	we will only handle "source", since it is a critical case.
